## Contributing

There are a couple of issues that could be solved in the future. If a role that manages employees is empty, employees managed by that position won't be able to select a manager. When an employee's role is updated, their manager is not. Both issues could be solved by associating the manager ID with a role instead of they way it's currently associated with an employee. That would require some substantial rewriting so it's logged here as a potential future improvement.
